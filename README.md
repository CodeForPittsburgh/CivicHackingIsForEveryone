# My reveal.js presentation template

I keep this repo around as a template for presentation slide decks. It
is based on [`reveal.js`](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) by
Hakim El-Hattab (and contributors), and reflects some presentation
"rules" I've defined for myself through trial and error over a few
years:

- I use a white background, with black as the primary foreground
  color. I've found this to work best even with low-quality projectors
  and under suboptimal lighting conditions, even for talk attendees
  with reduced eyesight or seated in the very back row.

- I use sans-serif fonts
  ([Cabin](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cabin) is my current
  favorite), with a typewriter-style monospace font (currently,
  [Special Elite](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Special+Elite))
  for links and highlights and another, simpler monospace font 
  ([Source Code Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Code+Pro))
  for code snippets.

- While I'm presenting, I want the progress bar and controls off.
  They're visually distracting, and I control the presentation from a
  remote anyway.

- Whenever I want to use graphics, I let them stand on their own, with
  no text, and I use them as a full-screen background. reveal.js,
  thankfully, makes this very easy, and will "just do the right thing"
  no matter whether you're presenting on a projector, on a tablet, or
  on your phone.

- I always write my slides in Markdown, and make heavy use of speaker
  notes through the `reveal.js` notes plugin.

For more information, watch my OSCON 2014 presentation:

Of course, the slides for that talk use this same approach, so [they
are hosted here on GitHub Pages](http://fghaas.github.io/oscon2014-presentationtoolbox/),
and you can also examine [the source code for them](https://github.com/fghaas/oscon2014-presentationtoolbox).

## How to use

Simple: just
[fork this repo](https://github.com/fghaas/presentation-template/fork)
and drop Markdown files into `markdown` and images into
`images`. Then, fix up `index.html` to include your Markdown-authored
sections.

This repo has two branches, one named `master` and one
`gh-pages`. Make sure you do your regular work in `master`, then merge
into `gh-pages` and push both branches. Your presentation will then be
rendered to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at a URL of the
form:

- http://*username*.github.io/*presentation-repo-name*

You can share the URL immediately, and GitHub will host it for you,
indefinitely, for free.

### Theming

The theme is defined in `css/reveal-override.scss` using
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/); if you update this, you will need to
re-compile into `css/reveal-override.css` via:

    $ sass css/reveal-override.scss css/reveal-override.css -t expanded

If you are doing continual development on the file, then run this in
the background to automatically re-compile every time the `.scss` file
is changed:

    $ sass --watch css:css -t expanded

If you are using GitHub Pages, make sure that the latest versions of
the generated `.css` files are committed and pushed to the remote
`gh-pages` branch.

### Running things locally

If you want to run your slides locally, rather than on GitHub Pages,
just drop them into the `DocumentRoot` of a web server, like Apache or
[`lighttpd`](https://www.lighttpd.net/).

For `lighttpd`, you may also want to set the following options:

```
dir-listing.encoding = "utf-8"
server.dir-listing   = "enable"
server.modules      += ( "mod_userdir" )
userdir.path         = "public_html"
```

Use the provided `.gitmodules` file to automatically clone local
copies of `reveal.js`,
[`qrcodejs`](https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/), and
[`reveal.js-menu`](https://github.com/denehyg/reveal.js-menu):

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then, create a symlink to your Git checkout in `~/public_html`, such as:

```bash
ln -s ~/git/my-presentation ~/public_html/
```

... and access your presentation from
http://localhost/~yourusername/my-presentation/
