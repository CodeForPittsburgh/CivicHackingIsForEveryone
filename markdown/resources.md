FYI

A quick Google search may be an easy way for you to get data, but what if the data are not spatial? What if you just have a table with no associated coordinates or addresses? You may need to join that table to a dataset that already has spatial information. 

For example, the Census separates the shapefile from different tables for ease of the user -- smaller, faster, and more relevant downloads. But that leaves you to join the table to the shapefile using your own spatial software. 

If you have trouble using data that you would like to use, feel free to contact us! (Contact information at bottom.)
