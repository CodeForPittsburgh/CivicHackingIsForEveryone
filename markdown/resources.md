## Checking the Data

... but Open Data may be your enemy.

Like with any research project, check your sources!  Some sources of error in GIS data are very obvious, whereas others are more difficult to notice. 


### 
Scale, for example, is an inherent error in cartography; depending on the scale used, we will be able to represent different type of data, in a different quantity and with a different quality. Cartographers should always adapt the scale of work to the level of detail needed in their projects.

Or errors can be intentionally introduced in GIS data. Most commonly, generalization which is used to reduce the amount of detail in a dataset, introduces error by removing aspects of a feature.

The age of data may be another obvious source of error. When data sources are too old, some, or a big part, of the information base may have changed. GIS users should always be mindful when using old data and the lack of currency to that data before using it for contemporary analysis.

A common mistake consists on label errors. For instance, an agricultural land may be incorrectly marked as a marsh, and this would cause an error that the map user may not notice because s/he may not be familiar with the area in question. 

Any good metadata should always include some basic information like age of the data, origin, area that it covers, scale, projection system, accuracy, format, etc.
