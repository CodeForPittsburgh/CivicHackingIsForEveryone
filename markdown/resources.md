## Checking the Data

... but Open Data may be your enemy.

Like with any research project, check your sources!  Some sources of error in data are very obvious, whereas others are more difficult to notice. Make sure to check if the dataset
* is for your desired time frame,
* is at the appropriate scale, and
* the source is reputable.
