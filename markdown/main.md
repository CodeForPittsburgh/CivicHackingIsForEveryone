# Framing and Diagramming the Issue

Framing an issue helps structure thinking about what the problem is about and how it can be addressed. Successful framing puts you in a favorable position to direct the discussion of the problem and improves the chances of a successful solution. 

If the it is framed as "common ground," the issue can be addressed from many angles. Most societal concerns are a result of several different factors. By examining the issue at its broadest level, you can address many of these factors.
